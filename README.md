# Hiking-Datalogger
A compact, standalone hike tracker built with an Arduino, GPS module, and SD card. It captures real-time position data to monitor route distance and hiking metrics.

The aim of this project will be to integrate an Arduino with an SD card, GPS module and battery to create a device that will track different metrics on a hike.
